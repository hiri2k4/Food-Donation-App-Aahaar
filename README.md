In densely populated countries like India, food wastage is a pressing issue. Streets, garbage bins, and landfills are filled with evidence of discarded food. Events such as weddings, gatherings, and functions, along with canteens and restaurants, contribute significantly to this problem. Food wastage not only highlights hunger and environmental pollution but also reflects deeper economic challenges. The rapid changes in lifestyle and the pursuit of higher living standards have led to the careless disposal of food, clothing, and other resources. 

Instead of letting these items go to waste, they can be repurposed by donating to organizations such as orphanages and old age homes. To address this issue, an internet-based Android application is proposed to facilitate charity through donations. The application will aim to minimize food wastage and meet other needs, such as providing clothes, books, and utensils, to those in need.

Every day, significant amounts of food are wasted at restaurants and cafés. Rather than discarding this food as trash, it can be redirected to feed the homeless. The proposed platform will arrange pickups, relieving restaurants and cafés of logistical concerns. This initiative benefits both the food establishments, by reducing their carbon footprint, and the needy, by addressing hunger.

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate that reducing food wastage is a crucial step toward sustainable production and consumption. It aligns with goals related to food security, combating climate change, and mitigating other environmental challenges. Public awareness campaigns and strategic plans will be developed to support this cause.
